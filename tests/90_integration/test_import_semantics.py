"""Integration tests for import semantics in different runtime modes.

This test explicitly verifies that import semantics work correctly in both
package mode (from src/) and stitched mode (from dist/apathetic_utils.py).

The test verifies that:
- Imports from apathetic_utils work correctly
- Exported constants and classes are accessible
- Values are correct regardless of runtime mode

This replicates the verification done in mode_verify/installed_example/installed_run.py
and mode_verify/stitched_example/stitched_run.py, but as a pytest integration test
that runs in both runtime modes.
