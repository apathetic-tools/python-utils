# 🧭 Roadmap

Some of these we just want to consider, and may not want to implement.

## 🎯 Core Features
- None currently

## 🧪 Tests
- Tests are slow, when to run what?


## 🧑‍💻 Development
- Beta phase, we need to use the library more to identify further improvements or problems


## 🔌 API
- Remove `__STANDALONE__` support from `detect_runtime_mode()` once all apps are converted to use `__STITCHED__`


## 📚 Documentation
- sticky the header
- bold the navbar link when on current page
- Where do we document the structure of the project? What do we document inside it vs here?
- Logo? Images? Icon? README banner?
- should we generate API docs? replace the ones in our docs?


## 💡 Ideas & Experiments
- None currently


> See [REJECTED.md](REJECTED.md) for experiments and ideas that were explored but intentionally not pursued.
